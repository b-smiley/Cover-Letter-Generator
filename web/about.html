      <h1>Cover Letter Generator</h1>
      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <p>
        This is a simple cover letter generator that allows you to input your
        information and generate a cover letter. The cover letter is generated
        in a PDF document format.
      </p>
      <h2>Goal of this application</h2>
      <p>
        The goal of this application was to find a way to automate the process
        of creating cover letters. This application is designed to be simple and
        easy to use.
      </p>
      <h2>How to Use</h2>
      <p>
        Create template file that has placeholder values for you to fill out.
        The template file name should not be changed from
        "cover_letter_template.txt". For a detail guide on each functionality
        please refer to the
        <span><a href="./help.html" class="no-visit">Help Page</a></span
        >.
      </p>
      <h2>Features</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Create a simple custom cover letter template</li>
        <li>
          Fill out your template information into a form that automatically
          populates your cover letter.
        </li>
        <li>Save the cover letter to a file destination in .pdf format</li>
        <li>
          Spellcheck warnings to ensure that your cover letter is free of
          spelling errors. (Still recommended to proofread)

          Use special variables to perform additional automation
          <ul>
            <li>
              Your_Name && Company_Name will be used to name the PDF file (if
              not specified, the file will be named "cover_letter.pdf")
            </li>
            <li>
              Todays_Date will be used to populate the date in the cover letter
            </li>
